# TTBT5 Project Overview

## Project Purpose

This is a placeholder application structure for the TTBT5 project, which is based on the TTBT2 comprehensive plan.

## Current Status

The project currently contains:
- A basic application structure
- Placeholder files for source code, tests, and documentation
- A requirements file for dependencies
- A main application file with minimal functionality

## Next Steps

To fully develop this application:
1. Obtain the content of the "Project TTBT2 Comprehensive Plan.txt" file
2. Implement features according to the requirements in that document
3. Add appropriate tests and documentation

## Directory Structure

```
ttbt5/
├── app.py              # Main application file
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
├── README.md           # Project documentation
├── src/                # Source code directory
├── tests/              # Test files
└── docs/               # Documentation
```

## Running the Application

To run the current placeholder application:
