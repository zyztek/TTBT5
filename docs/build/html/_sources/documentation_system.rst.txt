Documentation System
===================

Documentation Approach
---------------------

We follow a "documentation as code" approach, where all documentation is version-controlled alongside the codebase.

### Documentation Types

1. **Technical Documentation**
   - API documentation generated from code comments
   - Architecture diagrams and explanations
   - Deployment and operational guides

2. **User Documentation**
   - Quick start guides
   - Feature tutorials
   - Troubleshooting guides

3. **Developer Documentation**
   - Plugin development guides
   - Contribution guidelines
   - Coding standards and best practices

### Tools and Technologies

- **Sphinx**: Primary documentation generator with reStructuredText
- **Mermaid**: For diagrams and flowcharts
- **Read the Docs**: Hosted documentation platform
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated documentation builds

### Documentation Workflow

1. Documentation is written in reStructuredText format
2. Changes are reviewed in pull requests alongside code changes
3. Documentation is automatically built and deployed on merge
4. Versioned documentation is maintained for all releases
