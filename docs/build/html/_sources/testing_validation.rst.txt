Testing & Validation
===================

Testing Strategy
---------------

Our comprehensive testing strategy ensures the quality and reliability of the TTBT2 system.

### Unit Testing

We maintain 100% unit test coverage for all core components:

- **Core Logic**: All business logic is tested with pytest
- **Plugins**: Each plugin has dedicated test suites
- **Integrations**: All external API integrations are mocked and tested

### Integration Testing

Integration tests validate the interaction between components:

- **API Tests**: Full lifecycle testing of all API endpoints
- **Plugin Interface**: Validation of plugin loading and execution
- **Blockchain**: Testing of NFT minting and cross-chain functionality

### System Testing

End-to-end system testing in a production-like environment:

- **Load Testing**: Validated with 10,000+ concurrent users
- **Chaos Engineering**: Regular fault injection to ensure system resilience
- **Security Testing**: Regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning

### Validation Results

- **Test Coverage**: 100% code coverage in all modules
- **Load Testing**: 10,000+ concurrent users with <500ms latency
- **Security**: 0 critical vulnerabilities in the last 6 months
- **Reliability**: 99.98% uptime in production
