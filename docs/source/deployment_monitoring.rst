Deployment & Monitoring
=====================

Deployment Strategy
------------------

The TTBT2 system is designed for high availability and scalability using a multi-cloud architecture.

### Multi-Cloud Infrastructure

The system is deployed across multiple cloud providers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance:

1. **AWS (Primary)**
   - Amazon EKS for Kubernetes orchestration
   - Amazon S3 for storage
   - Amazon CloudFront for CDN

2. **Google Cloud Platform**
   - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for redundancy
   - Cloud Storage for backups
   - Cloud CDN for global content delivery

3. **Microsoft Azure**
   - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for additional redundancy
   - Azure Blob Storage for archival
   - Azure CDN for regional optimization

Deployment Pipeline
------------------

The deployment pipeline is fully automated using GitHub Actions and Terraform:

1. Code is pushed to the repository
2. GitHub Actions triggers the CI/CD pipeline
3. Automated testing and security scans are performed
4. Terraform applies the infrastructure changes
5. Docker images are built and pushed to the container registry
6. Kubernetes deployments are updated with zero downtime
7. Health checks and rollbacks are automated

Monitoring and Observability
--------------------------

We use a comprehensive monitoring stack:

1. **Prometheus** for metrics collection
2. **Grafana** for dashboards and alerting
3. **ELK Stack** for log aggregation and analysis
4. **Prometheus Node Exporter** for system-level metrics
5. **Blackbox Exporter** for end-to-end probing

Key metrics monitored:
- System health and resource utilization
- Application performance and error rates
- Business metrics (user engagement, plugin usage)
- Security events and anomalies
